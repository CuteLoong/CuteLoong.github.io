# About
Hi! I'm Xiaolong Wu, currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Shandong University, working with Prof. [Lu Wang](https://wanglusdu.github.io/) and Prof. [Junqiu Zhu](https://junqiuzhu.github.io/). 

My research focuses on achieving real-time photorealic rendering, exploring new geometric representations, efficient sampling methods, dynamic global illumination solutions, software ray tracing solutions, and post-processing techniques. I am also highly enthusiastic about technologies that improve rendering efficiency and quality.
